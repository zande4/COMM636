    <p id="p1">A musician wakes from a <b>terrible nightmare</b>. In his dream he finds himself in a society where
      music education has been made mandatory. <blockquote>“We are helping our students become more
        competitive in an increasingly sound-filled world.”</blockquote> Educators, school systems, and the state are
      put in charge of this vital project. Studies are commissioned, committees are formed, and
      decisions are made— all without the advice or participation of a single working musician or
      composer.
    </p>

    <p id="p2">
      Since musicians are known to set down their ideas in the form of sheet music, these curious
      black dots and lines must constitute the “language of music.” It is imperative that students
      become fluent in this language if they are to attain any degree of musical competence; indeed, it
      would be ludicrous to expect a child to sing a song or play an instrument without having a
      thorough grounding in music notation and theory. Playing and listening to music, let alone
      composing an original piece, are considered very advanced topics and are generally put off until
      college, and more often graduate school.
    </p>

    <p id="p3">
      As for the primary and secondary schools, their mission is to train students to use this
      language— to jiggle symbols around according to a fixed set of rules: <blockquote>“Music class is where we
        take out our staff paper, our teacher puts some notes on the board, and we copy them or
        transpose them into a different key. We have to make sure to get the clefs and key signatures
        right, and our teacher is very picky about making sure we fill in our quarter-notes completely.
        One time we had a chromatic scale problem and I did it right, but the teacher gave me no credit
        because I had the stems pointing the wrong way.”</blockquote>

      In their wisdom, educators soon realize that even very young children can be given this kind
      of musical instruction. In fact it is considered quite shameful if one’s third-grader hasn’t
      completely memorized his circle of fifths. “I’ll have to get my son a music tutor. He simply
      won’t apply himself to his music homework. He says it’s boring. He just sits there staring out
      the window, humming tunes to himself and making up silly songs.”
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the higher grades the pressure is really on. After all, the students must be prepared for the
      standardized tests and college admissions exams. Students must take courses in Scales and
      Modes, Meter, Harmony, and Counterpoint. “It’s a lot for them to learn, but later in college
      when they finally get to hear all this stuff, they’ll really appreciate all the work they did in high
      school.” Of course, not many students actually go on to concentrate in music, so only a few will
      ever get to hear the sounds that the black dots represent. Nevertheless, it is important that every
      member of society be able to recognize a modulation or a fugal passage, regardless of the fact
      that they will never hear one. <blockquote>“To tell you the truth, most students just aren’t very good at music.
      They are bored in class, their skills are terrible, and their homework is barely legible. Most of
      them couldn’t care less about how important music is in today’s world; they just want to take the
      minimum number of music courses and be done with it. I guess there are just music people and
      non-music people. I had this one kid, though, man was she sensational! Her sheets were
      impeccable— every note in the right place, perfect calligraphy, sharps, flats, just beautiful.
      She’s going to make one hell of a musician someday.”</blockquote>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Waking up in a cold sweat, the musician realizes, gratefully, that it was all just a crazy
      dream. <blockquote>“Of course!” he reassures himself, “No society would ever reduce such a beautiful and
        meaningful art form to something so mindless and trivial; no culture could be so cruel to its
        children as to deprive them of such a natural, satisfying means of human expression. How
        absurd!”</blockquote>

      <b>Sadly, our present system of mathematics education is precisely this kind of nightmare.</b> In
      fact, if I had to design a mechanism for the express purpose of destroying a child’s natural
      curiosity and love of pattern-making, I couldn’t possibly do as good a job as is currently being
      done— I simply wouldn’t have the imagination to come up with the kind of senseless, soulcrushing ideas 
      that constitute contemporary mathematics education.

                About Me
           </h2> 
           <p>
                I am a third year communications and computer science student at UNC. Is that really the most important thing about me?
                 I am from Metairie, Louisiana which is really close to New Orleans. This summer I enjoyed my existence as a human being.

            <h2>Website Purpose</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this website is to replicate an early internet style while using accesible HTML techniques. 
            This text has the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag and is part of an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag.</p>
        </article>

            <h2>Gallery</h2>
            <p>
                The gallery only contains pictures of pokemon. I am not a huge Pokemon fan (the only game I've finished is Scarlet),
                 but I really enjoyed watching the show as a kid and Pokemon Journeys more recently. I also have played A LOT of Pokemon Rumble
                 which is wii-ware that not many people have heard of.

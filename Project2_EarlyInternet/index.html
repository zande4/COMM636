    <title>Early Internet</title>
    <!--
        This project is something like a journal entry inspired by the styles of early internet hypertext narratives.
        I wanted to make it somewhat ominous as many works from that time seem to be. In order to make the website accessible I:
        - gave all images descriptive alt text
        - used semantic elements where possible
        - used aria-labels where screen-reader sounded awkward or inaccurate
        - used different background color on links to make the contrast with yellow text up to standard
